# Maze Game

## Introduction

This project is a simple maze game implemented in C++ using the Raylib library. The game generates a random maze and allows the player to navigate through it to reach the destination cell.

## Features

- **Random Maze Generation:** The maze is generated using a depth-first search algorithm, creating a unique layout each time you play.
  
- **Player Movement:** Control the player's movement using the arrow keys on your keyboard.

- **Destination Cell:** The destination cell is marked with a special color, making it the goal for the player to reach.

- **Congratulations Screen:** When the player successfully reaches the destination, a congratulations screen is displayed.

- **Restart Option:** After winning the game, the player has the option to restart and play again.
